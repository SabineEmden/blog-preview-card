## Overview

### The challenge

The brief for this project was to get the blog preview card looking as close to the design as possible, based on the following assets:

- Figma design files
- Mobile & desktop layouts
- Style guide with colors and fonts
- Optimized image assets
- Variable and static font files
- HTML file with pre-written contents

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Self-hosted variable web fonts
- Fluid typography

### What I learned

Four topics in this challenge were new to me:

- Variable web fonts,
- CSS custom properties,
- Styling links in different states,
- Fluid typography.

Of these four, fluid typography is the most complex. The article [Modern Fluid Typography Using CSS Clamp](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/modern-fluid-typography-css-clamp/) by Adrian Bece for Smashing Magazine gives a good introduction to the topic.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I could not find an online tool to subset the variable font (and keep it variable). I may have to look into command line tools, like [glyphhanger](https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger) by Zach Leatherman.

This project uses Josh Comeau's [CSS reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/).

I used [Fluid Style](https://fluid.style/) by Maxwell Barvian to generate the `clamp()` function for the fluid typography font sizes.
